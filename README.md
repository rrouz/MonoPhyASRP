- [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) - Multiple sequence alignment tool.
- [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/) - Phylogenetic tree inference software.
- [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) - Package and environment management system.
- [Autophy](https://github.com/aortizsax/autophy) - Ancestral sequence reconstruction tool.
